# HealthVision AI: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models for Streamlining Health Insurance Claims and Expense Reimbursements

During my internship at Accenture, I developed HealthVision AI, a cutting-edge solution designed to revolutionize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional OCR systems often need help accurately interpreting handwritten text and documents in non-standard formats. HealthVision AI addresses these challenges by utilizing LLMs that are adept at processing and understanding a wide range of visual and textual data. This innovative approach transforms extracted text into structured formats, significantly enhancing data processing and validation. Furthermore, HealthVision AI’s multilingual capabilities enable seamless recognition and processing of documents in multiple languages, making it a versatile tool for global applications.
HealthVision AI, while specifically optimized for medical and expense documents, is a versatile system that can adapt to handle a wide range of document categories. It has been rigorously tested with real data from a prominent Italian client, proving its effectiveness in processing health insurance claims and expense reimbursements.
The project takes a comprehensive approach, integrating cutting-edge technologies such as LangChain to create LLM-based applications, Streamlit to develop user-friendly web interfaces, and Azure AI Services to augment GPT-4 Vision’s OCR capabilities. This approach ensures the robust and reliable performance of HealthVision AI. Initial performance testing has demonstrated a remarkable 18% average increase in OCR accuracy compared to existing solutions, highlighting the project’s potential to revolutionize document processing workflows.
This thesis provides a comprehensive overview of HealthVision AI, including the internship context, a detailed literature review of OCR technologies and LLMs, system design and architecture, and the development and deployment processes. The results section presents a thorough performance and cost analysis, underscoring HealthVision AI’s efficiency and costs of implementation. By demonstrating the practical applications of LLMs in addressing critical OCR challenges, this project makes significant contributions to artificial intelligence. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the industry implications of HealthVision AI and potential areas for future research and development.
